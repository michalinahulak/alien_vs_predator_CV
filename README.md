## Alien vs Predator Computer Vision Classification

The Alien vs Predator project is a computer vision project that aims to classify images of two popular sci-fi characters, Alien and Predator. The project uses deep learning techniques to build an image classification model that can accurately identify whether an image contains an Alien or a Predator.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pmigdal/alien-vs-predator-images) and contains a total of 694 images of Aliens and Predators. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, with 500, 97, and 97 images, respectively.
